# Merlin

This game was created during my second year in OOP to demonstrate my knowledge of c# and OOP. The engine for this game was created by a teacher with a minimum of functionality. The physics of walking, jumping and intelligence of enemies was created by me.
In order to try out this game, you need to install the MerlinCore library, which can be found in the nuget packages by adding this link "http://hades.cit.fei.tuke.sk:8080/v3/index.json" to the nuget package sources.
Many elements of this game were not implemented due to lack of time before the deadline, so do not judge strictly
